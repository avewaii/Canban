- Hello! Today the guest in our improvised studio is Tanya.
- hello!
- And now we'll talk about Kanban. Tanya, what is it?
- It's special method of development or way of management your project.
- And what is essence?
- Kanban based on using special boards, that display all tasks, that your team has. Every task divided by stages
  and every stage corresponds to colunm on board. So, I can show you a simple sample of Kanban-board.
  So we can see the simple Kanban-board. We see three columns (new tasks, tasks in work and implemented tasks).
  Every column has some cards, that are visualising tasks, and when we take task in work, it goes through columns, through all stages.
  So we can say, that Kanban is a special way of visualization all process, all word, that we do in our projects.
- Ok, tell, how to work with Kanban?
- At first, you need to choose stages, whitch you will follow for implementation your tasks. It can be design, development, testing or
something else, but it's really important to choose stages. Then you can create this board in real physical world)) or use apps,
for example, Trello or Jira, or something else, that you like.
  Also it's really useful to set a limit active tasks in one column. It helps you to notice, that one column collected too many tasks,
  and you have some kind slowdown on this stage of your process of work. And also after creation board, you need to add tasks and try
  lead every task through all stages on your board. So workers move every task from one column to other column, and you, as manager,
  can see, what task is implemented or not implemented. And that way you detected disanvantages and suggest decisions and improve
  process of work. For example, you can change name of task, columns, add new columns, and if you see, for example, that column of design
  collected a really many tasks, you can hire a new designer. 
 - Ok, and what is other features of this method?
 - One of feature of Kanban is thet every task are tracked individually. It's mean, that as task got in work,
 it's evaluate individually and when task will be implemented, it can be turn in production. So, I can say,
 that the features of this method is what there is no strict schedule.
 - Doesn't it make a chaos? 
 - Of cousrse, it sometimes can create a chaos, but only if we have a work, that are not displayed on board.
 Bacause we have a untracked work, we lose control. And in case, when our board good organized and thanks visualization
 we can avoid chaos and make project better.
 - Thank you, Tanya. I think, it was very useful and interesting. Bye!
 - Bye!
